I'm picking the python language for this discussion.  For linting tools I found pycodestyle, and pyflakes among others.  I picked these because they are free and available on PyPi the python software repository.  For testing I chose unittest.  For building I found buildutils and buildout.  These were also chosen because they are free to use.
For continuous integration there are quite a few alternatives to GitHub Actions and Jenkins, though they all appear to be commercial.  I picked CircleCI and Buildkite. These are commercial tools but they do have a free tier.
If the project were small I would lean towards cloud hosting.  This would keep things simpler since the project would not require it's own infrastructure to be maintained.  The small size of the project would hopefully mean that we can take advantage of the free tier or at least have a lower cost for using the service.  For larger projects I would prefer to have in-house infrastructure.  This would reduce costs but with the tradeoff of maintaining the hardware.
